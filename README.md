## RISK 

We have 4 different risk mitigation strategies: 

- Accept Risk
- Avoid Risk
- Transfer Risk 
- Reduce Risk

  Governance
  Protection
  Defense
  Resilience
  



Start by identifying:
1. Vulnerabilities

Identify the:
2. Threats

3. Match controls to threats and vulnerabilities = attack surfacesses

4. Use the asset list and find asset owner


Calculate the risk of the asset and control mitigating the threat





### A areas of controls

- People Controls
- Organizational Controls
- Physical Controls
- Technological Controls

Homework note: Det her kunne man g√∏re og det her vil underst√∏tte foranstaltningen.

### Remember changes to ISO standards

Information technology is more than just a computer.
All things that are carrying information is regarded within the scope of ISMS/ISO27001

- A.5.7 - Threat Intelligence
- A.5.30 - ICT readiness for
- A.8.16 - Monitoring Activities
- A.8.11 - Data Masking (anonymisation & pseudonomization)
- A.8.9 - Configuration Management

We have an ISMS - We have this threat sk√¶rpe ikke udvande 



### Case;: WannaCry Ransomeware attack  Implementation of ISO27001 + ISO27002

Sources: ISO27001:2023 + ISO27002:2022 Document, [NIST CSF 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/informative-references), Lecturer from James H. Brink 

### CASE Description

Beside your job as IT-manager, you are now also IT-Security responsible, since the company want to implement:

IT-security ISO27001, so perhaps you ought to read it some day‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢ You just got that title and hasn‚Äôt yet meet with anyone ‚Äì or done anything. No one bother since we are busy
keeping the business going‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢ Your company has around 500 employees and all activities involves email, databases and even the phones are
depended on the call center servers. In other words: All business is going down if IT is going down

‚Ä¢ On your way to lunch an employee calls you and explain the files on the common network drive are changing
names and cannot be opened‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢ The employee shows you the file manager and you freeze‚Ä¶. You know exactly what this is: This is a successfully
penetration, and a ransomware has launched: WannaCry. And in every folder there is a text file claiming that you
only get you files back if you pay ransom in bitcoins ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢ Thankfully the backup-procedures run every night ‚Äì hopefully they work? And you hope the backup is air-gapped
in its design

Glossary: 

<-> = dependency

1. Step: Examine and Establish the Organisational Context
 
ISO27001 4.1 (Mandatory) <-> ISO38001:2018 5.4.1 & 6.3.3 External and Internal Context

| Internal Stakeholders | External Stakeholders | Cyber Security Expectations | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Call Center | - | Expect systems and servers for call handling are available 99% of time    |
| 500 employees | - | Changes to IT-proceses are easy to adopt, availability of 99% emails and documents / files   |
| C-Suite | - | Expect their departments deliver on base KPI's, expect that growth of business it-related processes are possbile, transparency in change management of IT processes can comply with standards that are familiar to the and devlops on current company standards, policies and procedures, satisfied employees |
| Board | - |  |
| Managers | - |  |
| HR | - | Store PII and be aware of regulatory compliance for conducting proactive recruiment |
| Precurement | - | easily understand and align porcess for aquiring systems with organisations ISMS.   |
| Marketing | - | Need available timely  information for sharing possibilities that can attract employees, busniess partners and customers.  |
| - | Business Partners |  |
| - | Legal/Regulatory  |  |

  

### WannaCry 

Available information: 

- IT is highly impacted and is highly critical to the business
- Ongoing succesful penetration attack from WannaCry
- File manager is impacted
- File restore is "possible" through bit coin payment
- Backup-procedures are present
- Airgap is unlikely present

#### Risk Assesment on incident WannaCry (Ransomeware):

If ISO was timely implemented we should have a documented incident response procedure according to control ISO27002:2022 - Clause 5.26 
- Response to information security incidents

Clause 5.26 ISO27002:2022 :

We will ask a competent designated team to respond according to Clause 5.24 Incident Management Procedures: 

The Incident Management Team must:
 - Understand our priorities for handling security incidents
 - Resolution time frame based on potential consequences and severity.


Prior to WannaCry. Management has created a incident management plan accoriding to Clause 5.24 Incident Management Procedures, which the designated teams follws: 


- [x] Is it an information security event?
- [ ] Has the event been monitoried, detected, classified, analysed and reported (human/automatic)
- [ ] Has the event been reported, escalated correctly to the end?
- [ ] Has crisis management been activated accordingly?
- [ ] Has continuity plans been activated?
- [ ] Has controlled recovery from incident been conducted?
- [ ] Has communication to internal and external insterested parties been executed?
- [ ] Has coordination with internal and external interested parties (authorities, external interest groups and forums, suppliers and clients been made?
- [ ] Has logging of incident management activities been activated and correctly made?
- [ ] Has root cause analysis or post-mortem procedures been made?
- [ ] Has identification of lessons learned and any improvements to the incident managment procedures or information security controls in general that are required been made?

##### Clause 5.24 Reporting Procedures

- [ ] Actions taken in case of an information security (IS) event
- [ ] Use of incident forms to support personnel to perform all necessary actions when reporting information security incidents
- [ ] suitable feedback processes to ensure that thos persons reporting IS-events are notified to the extent possible of outcomes after the issues has been addressed and closed
- [ ] Created of incidents reports

## Clause 6.8 Information security event reporting

Situtions for reporting IS-events:
- [ ] ineffective information security controls
- [ ] breach of information confidentiality, integrity or availability expectations
- [ ] human errors
- [ ] non-compliance with the information security policy, topic-specific policies or applicable standards
- [ ] breaches of physical security measures
- [ ] system changes that have not gone through the change management process
- [ ] malfunctions or other anomalous system behavior of software or hardware
- [ ] access violations
- [ ] vulnerabilities
- [ ] suspected malware functions

üî∫ Avoid testing and proving vulnerabilities.

- ISO27035-1:2023 Information technology - security incident management

### Case [Wannacry](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_angreb)

Brief WannaCry: 

 - Ransomeware
 - Microsoft Windows
 - MS17-010 vulnerabilty
 - Targets Protocol: SMB(Server Message Block)
 - Exploited TCP port 445 internet and LAN
 - EternalBlue Exploit (NSA developed)
 - Mitigation : KillSwitch can stop spread


We examine the list above and find that the case applies to:
- [X] suspected malware functions

We include this in the report:

Type of incident : suspected malware functions ransomeware
Date and Time : Lunch-time
Location : Every folder of Common Network Drive
Severity : HIGH

Discovery Methode : Visual inspection of files names on filemanager, every folder on Common Network Drive .

Evidence: 

 - [Witness] Employee: "files on the common network drive are changing names and cannot be opened‚Ä¶"
 -  [Text file] in every folder: claiming that you
only get you files back if you pay ransom in bitcoins ‚Ä¶
[WannaCry Example](https://github.com/orskoven/GRC/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-09-11%20at%2013.30.20.png)

Impact & Affacted Assets:

Data involved: Data on [common network drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage)
NAS server (default) redundant storage containers or RAID partion (not ransomeware protected).
Uses Protocols: NFS, SMB, AFP.

Implement -> 3-2-1 Backup strategy

## Is it an information security event?


### Immediate Mitigation of WannaCry/Ransomeware 

From [National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware-and-ransomware-attacks)

Steps to take if your organisation is already infected

If your organisation has already been infected with malware, these steps may help limit the impact:

Immediately disconnect the infected computers, laptops or tablets from all network connections, whether wired, wireless or mobile phone based.
In a very serious case, consider whether turning off your Wi-Fi, disabling any core network connections (including switches), and disconnecting from the internet might be necessary.
Reset credentials including passwords (especially for administrator and other system accounts) - but verify that you are not locking yourself out of systems that are needed for recovery.
Safely wipe the infected devices and reinstall the OS.
Before you restore from a backup, verify that it is free from any malware. You should only restore from a backup if you are very confident that the backup and the device you're connecting it to are clean.
Connect devices to a clean network in order to download, install and update the OS and all other software.
Install, update, and run antivirus software.
Reconnect to your network.
Monitor network traffic and run antivirus scans to identify if any infection remains.







### Unintended threats

- Power Failure
- Fire Hazards
- Wheather (Earthquake, floods and storms)


## Hardware

Hardware is expected to be maintained for 5 years, we need one to one equipment as bought, and service level agreements are made of 5 years duration.

## Physical/Power Security / Server Rooms / [Data Center Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center_security)

- UPS (battery) always cells are optimized by Electricians (prof.).
- Redundance in power supply. 
- Externally a diesel generator is supporting power.
- UPS also streamlines the voltage and removes peaks and valleys. 
- Metaldoors ensure serverrooms.
- Inactive gas is used to remove O2 (oxygen) from the room.
- Aircondition, to cool down servers.
- Humidity in server rooms need to be present, no zero humidity. Prefered (55 % Humidity).
- 25 degrees celcius is ok temperature to keep down.
- Cooling is not an issue.
- Early warnings alerting on mobile device regardning all instruments, powersupply (GOOD IDEA).
- Remote backup (important) - companies and people were vanished in 9-11 twin tower attack, and remote backups are critical.
- Norway has made atom-bomb safe vaults and backups in the mountains of norway.
- Split operations (2-sites) : remember to mirror eachother (complete redundant), perhaps lower the bandwith. Car security we have airbag and seatbelt.
- Consider wireless connections as backup for internet connections alwyas up.


## Intended threats

- EU, USA, China - are equally enemies in peace time regarding espionage.
- Advanced encryption used in Danish Foreign Affairs (active in the earlier Jugoslavian wars) technologies were being circumvented by backdoors to listen to high ranking politicians.
- Confidential about how we score things, and buy big military equipment, and that when
- Hacktivism -> anonymous, Terrists, Journalish
- Show-off hackers
- Internal / External fraud

 Governments
- Economic spionage
- Intelligence for the sake of National Security
- Investigation by Military or Police
- [Act of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli)

- USA iraq, one week prior to attack jam all big radiosender, tv's phone communication, to disable Iraq in communication reasonably.
- Jamming at Lolland (Denmark) Kaleningrad. Jam equipment. Russian forces were trying to jam sonars listening (FMI's Dalo Saildrones survailing russians) to cable destroyer in the baltic sea. ([Alexandr Frolov](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:4937128/mmsi:273542930/imo:0/vessel:ALEKSANDR_FROLOV) ships where jamming) 
- All Airports in denmark are equipted with visual landing systems (manuel landing) . But finland is harder hit with only GPS landing systems.


## Frameworks of defence

- USA has released [Ghidra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghidra) free NSA tool for reverse engineering and Kali.
- Ransomeware attacks are handlede by the attacker as a "Business".
- Industry of attack on the Dark Web.
- Surveilance 5 (Common wealth) - 9 (Denmark included) - 14 eyes (Sweden Germany)
- Denmark has been critised by [XKeyscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore) cable working together with the 9 eyes countries.
- Russian has [TOBOL GPS](https://www.gpsworld.com/russian-electronic-warfare-base-linked-to-gps-jamming-across-baltic-region/) jamming tools for targeted GPS jamming attacks Kaliningrad.
- [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) 
- Difficult to ensure no spys in hiren in big organisations.


## Exercise: Examine Exploits

### [Triple Fantasy](https://www.colocationamerica.com/blog/kaspersky-uncovers-equation-group)

###### APT
Exploits the cache when the HDD read write operations stored in the RAM (for speed up pupose). Linux system handles in the HDD the control of the cache. The SYSTEM was compromised, and can compromise the HDD even though the OS has been wiped, and cannot be inspected without physical acess to the HDD bios. Kaspersky discovered this since they wiped the systems and they still were communicating with the internet in their lab. 

One of the most serious and advanced persistent threats in modern history.
 

###### We have to assume breach 

### Attack Surfaces




#### Stegosploit

Embedded picture with malware.


# ISO27001 & ISO27002 

###### Change management is hard

When hired for it-security we will find change management and implementing the more secure practices as the hardest part of the job, which is often the standard job when hired from college/ junior cyber security governance employee. 

C-Suit, leaders are "busy" and often hard to get to listen. 

We cannot implement the technologies alone, we have to orchestrate cross diciplinary (HR, IT, Operations, Leaders at all levels). 

## ISO27001 & 2 Ongoing Identifcation: 

- Assets
  
- Vulnerabilties

How exposed am i?
  
- Threats

How likely am i to be attacked?
  
- Internal organization
  
- Central Documents
  
- Risks

# Case : Rigspolitiet / national police hacked

##### Under attack : Rigspolitiet / Systems of [CSC](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Sciences_Corporation) (USA software-system developer) |¬†Dansih Driver Licenses and shared EU-System for wanted persons and ID-papers (1,2 million) [SCHENGEN INFORMATION SYSTEMS](https://www.computerworld.dk/art/234507/det-store-csc-hack-datatilsynet-klar-med-haard-kritik-af-rigspolitiet) 

##### Security measures were low 

##### Who is attacking? : Pirate Bay co-founder colaborated  un-known √òsterbro (Dansish) guy 

##### Confidentiality [High-Impact] 

 - Breach in the security and disclosure of 1,2 millions records of PII.
   
##### Integrity  [High-Impact] 

 - IDS was not logging and active
   
 - No seperations and compartmentalisation of data-controllers system and data processor services. CSC systems mainframe partitioned and used for storing Rigspolitiets data.
 - Mainframe not isolated from the internet
 - [LPAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_partition) access to open to the internet and open to another datacontrollers operational needs. 
 - network security was designed at the needs of the dataprocessor and not data controller.
 - Containment of Schengen informationssytem data stored after processed and not needed any longer.


###### Ensure all orders [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law))  everything signed 

### ISO27001 First Move

Organisation is an organism. The size of organisation is growing and complexity is rising and maturity in the it leadership is often too low. 

##### Who is responsible? 

Firstly we must, as IT-professional, throw the ball to the CEO (in a well communicated manner towards our own boss). 

We need the buy-in from the CEO, to get the authority to communicate to other employees the authority. 

##### Make a Security Commitee

Key stakeholders in the company must be assembled to point out and describe the most effective policies.

##### Tasks of Security Commitee
- Guidelines for making policies
- Develop guidlines and rules for Risk Assesments for current and future systems.
- Employee security to protect against employees.
- Asset management and classification (electronic, spoken, paper).
-  #### Annual Wheel, meetings, reports and action plans

##### Organizational employees of IT-Security

- ###### Information Security Commitee
- ###### IT-Security Manager
- Data Manager
- Opertion Manager
- Network Manager
- DPO

### SCOPING ISO27001

ISO27001 [CERTIFIED] - includes - ISO27002 are tighly coupled 

- Risk owner in larger companies
- Management
- Employees
- Operation Responsible
- Network Responsible
- Leaders and Managers
- more

#### Security Policy

- ISMS and the org
- Employee Safety
- Assets and Classification
- Access Control
- Methode for Risk Assesment
- Communication Plan
- Supplier Management
- Development and Test
- Operation Safety
- Perimeter Safety
- Supplier Management
- Security Incidents and IT-Contigency + Incident Response
- Annual Reports

Remember to describe all incident plans. 
How to go from incident back to normal operation. (Remember!)
We need a guide to act reasonable.

###### Rules and Penalty for violating policies!

As security advisors, we can order the manager to fire people, since they get a salary compensation for firing.


#### ISO27002:2022

Newly revised to match Cyber Security & Cloud growing need in ISMS controls. 

- People Controls
- Physical Controls
- Technological Controls (most controls)
- Organisational Controls

Mapping 27002:2013

#### Technological Controls
IMPORTANT MONITORING ## SIEM ## :
- Logging (we need to log) SIEM products analyse logs [Important Controls]. False negative / False positives. SWEET SPOT.


###### 5 Attributes

- Control Types
- Information Security Properties
- Cybersecurity Properties
- Operational Capabilities
- Security Domains


Further controls that could add on to ISO27002 93 controls:
### [GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng)
### [AI ACT](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai) 
### [DORA](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en)
### [NIS2](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/da/policies/nis2-directive) 

### Important factors for defining policies and ongoing work

- risk analysis - need for more policies
- all 14 controls to analyse need for policies
- control the Asset List: Any system need not covered
- C-suit meeting conrolling need for special policies
- Policy testing

### Align All Policies

- Emergency rules
- Departments have specific rules based on location
- Legislation have rules all must obey prior polocies obeying
- Combine all policies and references in one place to ensure employees stay informed, not miss "must knows".


## CASE: Implement in an organisation

## NEXT Lecture : mandatory presentation 

Explain 4 Areas of controls

- Organisational
- People
- Physical
- Technological

The idea of the Area
Strategic Example for scoping the policy
Pick a random control in the area - explain what its about (tactical) 
How would you implement that control? Rules and procedures (Operational)?
How would you make a revision.

## Work with a well-known attack (group work) case WannaCry

IMPORTANT : C-Suite language needs to understand the actions taken to mitigate WannaCry attack.

#### Answer

- Reasearch the validity of the attack (triangulate the information) look for cross references.
- How many systems where impacted
- have any preventative measures already been taken to mitigate (complying with the policies for incident/ non-compliant actions)? 
- What is the criticality
- Can Operations still ongo?
