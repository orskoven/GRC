This blog features all my notes regarding Governance Risk and Compliance while studying Cyber Security at KEA .

### Unintended threats

- Power Failure
- Fire Hazards
- Wheather (Earthquake, floods and storms)


## Hardware

Hardware is expected to be maintained for 5 years, we need one to one equipment as bought, and service level agreements are made of 5 years duration.

## Physical/Power Security

UPS (battery) always cells are optimized by Electricians (prof.).
Redundance in power supply. 
Externally a diesel generator is supporting power.
UPS also streamlines the voltage and removes peaks and valleys. 
Metaldoors ensure serverrooms.
Inactive gas is used to remove O2 (oxygen) from the room.
Aircondition, to cool down servers.
Humidity need to be present, no zero humidity.
25 degrees celcius is ok temperature to keep down.
Cooling is not an issue.
Early warnings alerting on mobile device regardning all instruments, powersupply (GOOD IDEA).
